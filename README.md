# Athenas-ASS-to-Hunter-s-Simulator-for-MH4U-converter
This is a script to convert the files containing the charms of a player in [Athenas ASS](facebook.com/AthenasArmorSetSearch/) to the files used by [Hunter’s Simulator for MH4U](play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thisisgame.mhsimul)

***ROOT REQUIRED***

## How to use
Clone the repo into a folder and put the `mycharms.txt` file from the data folder from the folder where the Athenas ASS exe is stored and the `charms.db` file from Hunter’s Simulator for MH4U (`/data/data/com.thisisgame.mhsimul/databases/`) into the same folder. Run the script with Python 3 and put the edited `charms.db` back on your phone to `/data/data/com.thisisgame.mhsimul/databases/`.
